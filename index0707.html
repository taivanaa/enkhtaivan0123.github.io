                <p class="fcol">after a natural disaster</p>
                <p class="fsize">in the midst of a huge natural disaster, many are compelled
                    to do whatever the can to help. however, certain donations 
                    actually make refief oprations run much less efficmently. put
                    those canned goods down try to donate these instead.

           <p class="fcol1">YOUR TIME</p>
           <P class="fsize1">if tou haven't been affected by the disaster, donate your time to 
               organization such as the Red Cross, or even your local church and help 
               the relief operation process.

           <p class="fcol2">CLEAN UNDERWEAR</p>
           <P class="fsize2"> It's easy to take simplest things for granted. Underwear isn't the first thing that comes to mind when it comes to
                                donations, and there's a great need for them.</P>

           <p class="fcol1">SPACE</p>
           <P class="fsize2">Spaces such as warehouse facilities or even parking lots are very
                            useful in the midst of a disaster. They can be used for
                            housing facilities, donation storage, and relief operation.

           <p class="fcol2">LAUNDRY SERVICES</p>
           <P class="fsize2">Offer to wesh clothes of disaster victims instead of donation
                                clothes. Getting clean clothes to victims that actually
                                fit them is important in

           <P class="fsize2">With dirty water lines and sewers, and limited access to clean food,
                                cleaning supplies are necessary, especially in a major natural disaster.

           <P class="fsize1">The sun can get pretty bad after typhoons or heavy
                            rains. Sunscreen can help not only volunteers who 
                            will be out for long periods of time, but especialy people who
                            have been displaced from their homes.</P>

             <p class="fcol"></p>
             <p class="fsize">Cash is the most useful thing you can donate after a natural disaster.
                 This allow refief operations and foundations to allocat funds to where they're really needed. 
                 instead of a $1 can of tuna, $1 can buy more significant amount of nutritions food when 
                 purchased in bulk.
